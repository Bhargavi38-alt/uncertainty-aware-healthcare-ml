Ethical Scope & Research Intent: 

This project explores how diagnostic uncertainty and error asymmetry arise in structured tumour measurement data, using transparent and interpretable data science methods to support cautious decision-making. 

This analysis does not seek to establish biological causality, recommended treatment, or replace clinical judgment. Any interpretation beyond these bounds would be inappropriate and inconsistent with the stated scope of this work. Instead, the analysis focuses on identifying regions of uncertainty where automated predictions may warrant additional human review to reduce the risk of unnecessary harm. 

All analyses are conducted on publicly available, de-identified datasets and are framed as educational and exploratory. References to clinical intuition or published research are used solely to inform interpretation and evaluation, not to assert medical authority. 

The project explicitly acknowledges: 

**limitations inherent to the dataset, 

**the absence of patient-level outcomes or quality-of-life data, and 

**the risk of bias introduced by both the data and analytical choices. 

Artificial intelligence and machine learning are explicitly positioned as decision-support tools. Any attempt to interpret their outputs as autonomous decision-making would constitute a misuse of this analysis. Where model behaviour conflicts with research-informed expectations or exhibits high uncertainty, the appropriate response is increased human oversight, not automated action. 

In cases where analytical findings differ from clinical judgment or established medical practice, the interpretation and decision of qualified medical professionals take precedence, as they integrate experiential, contextual, and patient-specific factors beyond the scope of this analysis.
